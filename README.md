# Quantamental---Risk-Management
Investing wisely requires a discerning eye for not just promising opportunities but also potential investment pitfalls. This delicate balance can be achieved through a quantamental approach, a method that synergizes quantitative analysis with in-depth financial scrutiny.

This quantamental process provides a structured approach to navigate the complex landscape of stock investment, focusing on identifying high-risk companies within underperforming industries. By combining quantitative performance data and initial screening of financial health indicators, investors can make wiser decisions, potentially avoiding stocks that could have a negative impact on their investment portfolios.
